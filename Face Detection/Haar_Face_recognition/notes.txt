Face detection is performed using classifiers.
Determines whether a face is present or not.

Pre trained classifiers in OpenCV
1. Haar Cascades - sensitive to noise
2. Local binary patterns (advanced) -> Not prone to noise as much as Haar Cascades.

Haar cascades - https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades
available for eye, face, whole body, cat face, russian number plate, smile etc.,
haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml - for face detection

Face Detection doesn't involve skin tone or the colours that are present in the image.
The haar cascades essentially looks at an object in an image.
Using edges tries to determine whether face is there or not.

Lesser the value of minNeighbors, the more prone to noise is haar cascade.
It tries to identify as many faces as possible. 
But increasing the minNeighbors restricts the number of faces, since noise is removed.
So it is required to find a balance.
