For labels we use numbers instead of strings as it reduces the load on the system.
We basically create a mapping with the number and the string.

For face detection we use cv2.face.LBPHFaceRecognizer_create()
We get the cordinates of the faces in the image by using Haar Cascade face model.
We provide the cordinates of the face along with labels to train the model.

OpenCV let's us save the model as yml files.
Although for loading the model we have to call the class of the model.
