Opening is erosion followed by dilation.
closing is dilation followed by erosion.
Gradient is the difference between the eroded image and the dilated image.
Tophat is the difference between the opened image and the input image.
Blackhat is the difference between a closed image and an input image



We can do median blur to clean up the noise or erosion and dilation to remove noise
We can follow it by thresholding.
